## 📝 How to Update Content (No Coding Required!)

You can use **GitHub Copilot** directly on GitHub.com to help you make changes. Here's how:

### Step 1: Open the File on GitHub

1. Go to the repository: [github.com/PFSkiturenWebsite/website-2026](https://github.com/PFSkiturenWebsite/website-2026)
2. Click on `index.html` (this is the main website file)
3. Click the **pencil icon** (✏️) to edit the file

### Step 2: Use GitHub Copilot to Make Changes

Once you're in edit mode, you can use Copilot in two ways:

#### Option A: Ask Copilot Chat (Recommended)

1. Look for the **Copilot icon** in the toolbar or press `Ctrl+I` / `Cmd+I`
2. Type what you want to change in plain language:

> "Change the price from 5995 DKK to 6295 DKK"

> "Update the departure date to January 24, 2026"

> "Add a new FAQ question: 'Is ski equipment included?' with answer 'No, but you can rent at the destination.'"

3. Copilot will suggest the changes - click **Accept** to apply them

#### Option B: Edit Directly

1. Use `Ctrl+F` / `Cmd+F` to find the text you want to change
2. Make your edits directly in the file
3. Copilot will offer suggestions as you type

### Step 3: Create a Pull Request

1. Scroll down after making your changes
2. Write a short description of what you changed (e.g., "Update price to 6295 DKK")
3. Select **"Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request"**
4. Give the branch a name (e.g., `update-price`)
5. Click **"Propose changes"**
6. Click **"Create pull request"**

### Step 4: Your Changes Go Live! 🎉

Once someone reviews and merges your PR, GitHub Pages automatically deploys the updated website within a few minutes.
